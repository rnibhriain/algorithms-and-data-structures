	 * Counts for the number of non-hoizontal lines that go through 3 points in arrays a1, a2, a3.
	 * This method is static, thus it can be called as Collinear.countCollinear(a1,a2,a3)
	 * @param a1: An UNSORTED array of integers. Each integer a1[i] represents the point (a1[i], 1) on the plain.
	 * @param a2: An UNSORTED array of integers. Each integer a2[i] represents the point (a2[i], 2) on the plain.
	 * @param a3: An UNSORTED array of integers. Each integer a3[i] represents the point (a3[i], 3) on the plain.
	 * @return the number of points which are collinear and do not lie on a horizontal line.
	 *
	 * Array a1, a2 and a3 contain points on the horizontal line y=1, y=2 and y=3, respectively.
	 * A non-horizontal line will have to cross all three of these lines. Thus
	 * we are looking for 3 points, each in a1, a2, a3 which lie on the same
	 * line.
	 *
	 * Three points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) are collinear (i.e., they are on the same line) if
	 * 
	 * x1(y2−y3)+x2(y3−y1)+x3(y1−y2)=0 
	 *
	 * In our case y1=1, y2=2, y3=3.
	 *
	 * You should implement this using a BRUTE FORCE approach (check all possible combinations of numbers from a1, a2, a3)
